# Rails Engineering Curriculum

Just knowing how to spin up a Rails app doesn't make one a great programmer; thatâ€™s the easy part of Rails development. What is important is thinking like an engineer. Programming is a lifelong study, and the goal of this class is to impart the skills needed to be continually learning and improving. What we covered in these three months ranges from foundational concepts to complex libraries and frameworks. Topics build upon themselves; the logic learned in weeks 1 and 2 are used to build interactive systems in weeks 8 and 9, connected with databases, APIs, and JavaScript. Students are not simply taught the latest libraries, but are taught why they are used and what the best practices are around them to write clean and elegant code.
