bio: Artsy-type, Kid-haver. Katlyn studied Theatre at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. After college, she was on the road to pursuing a career in Acting/Directing when she got pregnant. When no one would cast her in all her pregnant glory, she decided to start doing stand-up comedy. At the very least, people would laugh at how weird she looked. After doing stand-up for a couple of years, she had her second daughter and decided that the life of a traveling comedian was not what she wanted as a mother. She decided to make a life change, which included attending the Iron Yard, herself! She graduated from the Front End Engineering program in Atlanta in August 2014. She loved TIY so much, she decided she wanted to work there. Luckily, the feeling was mutual, and here she is!
