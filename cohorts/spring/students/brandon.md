course: design
bio: Brandon is a home-grown Louisiana boy with experience in everything from flipping burgers, to building houses, to guiding hunters to selling trailers, to you name it.  And though he wouldn't trade those experiences in for the world, he alway's felt a more natural inclination toward's all things design.  Whether it was drawing, painting, or creating something crazy in the garage (making so called "improvements" to common house-hold products), he was alway's designing something.  But It wasn't until this year that he realized he could design as a career.  At present, he aim's to use the knowledge he's gained at the Iron Yard, and the knowledge he's gained from his past, to design the next big thing.  When he's not designing, you might catch him speeding through bike trail's on the Austin greenbelt, or even kicking it back to watch a Christopher Nolan film with his friends.
