bio: ​​Daniel St. Clair had always had a curiosity for what it is that engages people. A musician turned front-end web developer, his appetite for coding came after one night of accidentally opening chrome inspector. The experience reminded him of listening to The Who's "Baba O'Reiley" for the first time and he hasn't turned back since. When he's not in code-land, Daniel enjoys playing music, reading Christopher Moore books or relaxing at home with his wife and cats.
