bio: ​​Hughie Devore is a web developer currently enhancing the world by way of Austin, TX. His epic journey from financial programmer to socially impactful web developer was driven by his infectiously upbeat attitude and insatiable thirst for knowledge. Hughie's free time revolves around building sustainable technology, crafting music, and soaking up the bliss (and beer) of Austin with his Wife. If you were to encounter Hughie on a busy street, you'd be able to spot him from a rugby pitch away, just look for the Sasquatch smiling at everyone he passes.
