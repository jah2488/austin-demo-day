bio: Travis Czerw has done a bit of everything, from non-profit administration and payroll to working on farms and being a licensed irrigator. The constants along this journey are a love of building and learning. Besides perhaps having the most difficult last name to pronounce ever, he loves all types of games, carpentry, gardening, and going on historically-based tirades.
