bio: ​​Erika Moller is afflicted with curiosity. She started out doing graphic design and social media for startups and non-profits and along the way discovered that coding was not as mysterious and intimidating as the pedestal she put it on. She found herself spending more time looking at the code of the website she managed than creating and designing the content on it. Empowered by the freedom to build and learn anything she wants, she's a self-taught videographer, photographer and an Adobe Creative Suite fan.
