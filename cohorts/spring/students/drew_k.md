bio: "“As a man thinks, so shall he be.” This is a quote New Orleans native Drew Kerr lives by. Drew wants his life to be a living testament of what one can accomplish despite difficult circumstances. His passions include: learning, fashion, food, travel, music, film and sports. Drew found the world of tech and big data fascinating and it peaked his interest so he began a journey of learning how to code. After teaching himself how to program for close to a year, he felt that he needed immersive training to better prepare himself for a career in tech. The Iron Yard has provided that need as well as increased his interest to learn more. Ultimately, Drew wants to use his skill set and talents to pursue his dreams of entrepreneurship and philanthropy."
