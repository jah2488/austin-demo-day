bio: ​​After 20 years managing projects and operations in large corporate environments, Paul Kokoszyna came to the Iron Yard to add a technical arrow to his quiver of skills. He appreciates opportunities to accomplish challenging goals as evidenced by his regular participation in Crossfit Training and endurance races such as the Leadville 100. He is proud to always finish in the top 100%.  When he’s not spending his time reading or contemplating the next best idea to pitch on Shark Tank, Paul works on improving his ability to follow directions dictated to him by his 7 and 5 year old daughters, who currently have him on a performance improvement plan.
