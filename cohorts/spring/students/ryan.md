bio: Ryan is an ex-professional poker player who now runs SumoJerky - a subscription box service for people who love beef jerky. He loves learning new things and is training to build one useful web app, compete in one MMA match, and play in one PRO-AM beach volleyball tournament before he's 40. He might be able to accomplish these things were he not so obsessed with reading & commenting on college football blogs.
