bio: As  an unconventional developer Robert Balderas  lives outside the box.  A  proponent of “forgiveness over permission”  he pushes the limits of software development, breaking-dancing, and comedy.  With past careers in manufacturing, chemistry, finance, and SaaS he brings an arsenal of perspectives which coupled with education in back-end engineering makes  him an invaluable asset to any start-up. When not hacking away at heroku bugs  Robert regularly participates in hackathons.  He loves  building apps poised to disrupt markets and perfecting his pitch.

  I am America and so can YOU!
