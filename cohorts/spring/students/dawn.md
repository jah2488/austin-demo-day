bio: Dawn grew up in New Orleans, LA and traveled all around the Southeast, pursuing a degree in Fine Arts, with a focus on sculpture and painting.
She has a deep love of the creative process, so when she discovered web design and development, she dove in head first.
Her and her husband (of 8 years—whoop!), along with their dog, love exploring the city and finding every possible entrance to Austin’s beautiful Greenbelt.
Her current life goals include, but are not limited to, perfecting her grandmothers pain perdu recipe and continuing on her journey to become an exceptional web designer.
