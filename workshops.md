# Learn how the web works!
We're offering free crash courses at our campus for those interested in learning more about the web. The web has become an essential tool for everyone, but for many people what goes on underneath the buttons, images and apps is a mystery. Join us for these classes on the basics. We'll dive in, get our hands dirty and you'll walk away with knowledge you can apply immediately.
Here's Iron Yard Partner, John Saddington, with more about the courses:
